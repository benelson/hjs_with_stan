Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception thrown at line 55: stan::math::uniform_log: Upper bound parameter is 25, but must be greater than 31.6996
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
