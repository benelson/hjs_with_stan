INFO:pystan:COMPILING THE C++ CODE FOR MODEL anon_model_38c7dfdf589ceff4d0b8844c13ee2adf NOW.

Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception thrown at line 26: stan::math::uniform_log: Upper bound parameter is 25, but must be greater than 238.468
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
