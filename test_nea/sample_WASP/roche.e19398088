INFO:pystan:COMPILING THE C++ CODE FOR MODEL anon_model_f74e2c46df5b921472f88cf17e4808b0 NOW.

Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception thrown at line 55: stan::math::uniform_log: Upper bound parameter is 30, but must be greater than 983.384
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.

Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception thrown at line 57: stan::math::normal_log: Location parameter[1] is inf, but must be finite!
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
