INFO:pystan:COMPILING THE C++ CODE FOR MODEL anon_model_0d951d19679772f990d4c6eade90a5bf NOW.

Informational Message: The current Metropolis proposal is about to be rejected because of the following issue:
Exception thrown at line 26: stan::math::uniform_log: Upper bound parameter is 30, but must be greater than 249.386
If this warning occurs sporadically, such as for highly constrained variable types like covariance matrices, then the sampler is fine,
but if this warning occurs often then your model may be either severely ill-conditioned or misspecified.
